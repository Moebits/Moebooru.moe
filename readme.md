# Moebooru.moe

Moebooru is an image board site for cute anime art, organized by tags. It is inspired from other similar image boards (danbooru, yandere, etc.)

### Searching With Spaces

Moebooru's tags use the dash ("-") as the delimeter, but the search can guess what tags you are looking for even if you use spaces.

### Multiple Images Per Post

Moebooru supports multiple images per post, which is great for comics and posts with lots of variations. We also still have the usual parent/child relationships for third-party posts.

### Image Filters

You can apply image filters such as brightness, contrast, and hue in realtime. There is also a very fun pixelate filter that 
can make everything look like a pixel game.

### Custom GIF/Video Players

Moebooru uses custom javascript gif/video players, so you can do many things that aren't normally possible like pausing/seeking 
gifs, reverse playback, and modifying playback speed.
