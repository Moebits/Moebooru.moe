# Moebooru.moe

Moebooru is an image board site for cute anime art. It is inspired from danbooru and other similar image boards, but is otherwise
unrelated. The primary differences are that Moebooru supports multiple images per posts, supports spaces in tags, and has a large
variety of image filters and other special effects. 

There are four color themes, purple, magenta, purple light, and magenta light.
